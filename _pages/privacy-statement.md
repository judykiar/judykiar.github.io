I am a Registered Psychotherapist (ID #2897) and a Canadian Certified Counsellor. My practice is supervised by Dr. Rebecca Moore, Clinical Psychologist Registered in Ontario (ID #5297). That means that I meet with her regularly to discuss my clients, ensuring a high level of professional competence. Clinical supervision adheres to confidentiality guidelines. Because of this supervisory relationship my services are covered by most private health insurance plans.

We are members of the Ontario Association of Marriage and Family Therapists and follow their code of ethics, found at [http://www.oamft.on.ca](http://www.oamft.on.ca).

Confidentiality is one of the most important aspects of a therapeutic relationship. Clients must be certain that everything they reveal in counselling is kept in strictest confidence, including all identifying information. To this end, I will never share any identifying information with another individual/agency for any reason, unless instructed to do so by the client. In that case an Ontario Form 14 (release of information) will be required from the client.

The only limits to confidentiality are in cases of abuse or danger to the client or someone else. In that case I have an ethical duty to report this to the appropriate authorities. It is my usual practice to inform clients if this is the case.

If you have any questions about confidentiality, please feel free to bring them up with me directly.
